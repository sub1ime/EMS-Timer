EMS Timer Outline
=====================

-This should be a pebble app that allows users to keep track of their own times when running EMS calls
-There will be different phases of the call
	-En route
	-On Scene
	-Pt. contact
	-Transporting
	-At Destination
	-Clear
-These times will be recorded and then sent to an app on the phone where all of the times are compiled as well as some statistics and a summary sheet shown
-The app could possibly email these times
-I want to find a way to allow the times to be edited on the watchapp and the phone app
-There will be a timer constantly running showing overall time elapsed
-The right sided buttons will update themselves to the next option and then show the current option
